As both a programmer and a person, a quote that speaks to me the most and keeps me motivated to keep moving forward is the following:

I started coding my junior year of high school when I was trying out new things in order to figure out what I wanted to do in college. I took a summer class which was the complete beginner's class in C; however, despite being for complete beginners, I still struggled through the entire class, thinking everything the instructor was saying was in a foreign language. Even the simplest code:

`printf("Hello world!");`

was confusing to me because I simply just did not understand what programming even was.

It was not until I entered college and took my first class CSE 5A for a summer engineering program. It was this class and probably also the fact that I was surrounded by supportive peers in similar situations as I that I finally got a grasp on what I was doing. I proceeded to take the following classes:

- CSE 11
- CSE 12
- CSE 15L
- CSE 30
- CSE 20
- CSE 21
- CSE 105
- CSE 100
