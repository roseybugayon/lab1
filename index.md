## My beginning

As both a programmer and a person, a quote that speaks to me the most and keeps me motivated to keep moving forward is the following:

> "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. - Wayne Gretsky" - Michael Scott

I started coding my junior year of high school when I was trying out new things in order to figure out what I wanted to do in college. I took a summer class which was the complete beginner's class in C; however, despite being for complete beginners, I still struggled through the entire class, thinking everything the instructor was saying was in a foreign language. Even the simplest code:

`printf("Hello world!");`

was confusing to me because I simply just did not understand what programming even was.

## UCSD

It was not until I entered college and took my first class CSE 5A for a summer engineering program. It was this class and probably also the fact that I was surrounded by supportive peers in similar situations as I that I finally got a grasp on what I was doing. I proceeded to take the following classes:

- CSE 11
- CSE 12
- CSE 15L
- CSE 30
- CSE 20
- CSE 21
- CSE 105
- CSE 100

## Research

My research group has been something very important to me this past year. It was actually from my experience in this particular research that I received my internship offer from SCE. Our research involves analyzing COVID-19 DNA sequences and their potential transmissions to other individuals which could tell us potential factors affecting the transmissions. The process of our research is as follows:

1. Collect data from GISAID database
2. Alignment of DNA sequences using ViralMSA
3. Calculate the pairwise distance of the sequences using TN-93
4. Present results through data visualizations
5. Make inferences about the graphs presented

We are currently on steps 4 and 5. We are attempting presenting the data in different ways that would allow us to make the most significant inferences in terms of the factors that affected the spread of the virus.

## Summer Engineering Institute

I think my favorite part of attending UCSD through the Jacobs School of Engineering was having the opportunity to attend the Summer Engineering Institute. This was probably, as of today, my most fondest memory of college. I made the majority of my current friends at this summer program and essentially met the rest of my friends through their friends. I think more engineering students should attend this program because it was an amazing introduction and transition into college. For some pictures of the program, [go here](/SEI_images).
